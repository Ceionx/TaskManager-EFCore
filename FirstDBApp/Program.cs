Task Management System (like Trello)
Core Features:
Task Boards: Users can create task boards with different columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
Task Management: Add, update, delete, and move tasks between columns.
User Collaboration: Allow multiple users to collaborate on the same board.
SQL Features: Use many-to-many relationships to assign tasks to multiple users, and implement triggers for automatic notifications.
Learning Outcomes:
Working with collections and generics in C#.
Real-time updates using SignalR (if you want to expand to advanced topics).
Advanced querying in SQL, such as CTEs (Common Table Expressions).*/
